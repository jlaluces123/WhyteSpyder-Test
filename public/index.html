      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
      user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      !!!!!!!!! Hey WhyteSpyder team !!!!!!!!!

      I first just wanted to say thank you for giving me this opportunity to build something out for you guys!
      While I didn't get to add some bells and whistles I did my best to add some responsiveness and a little bit of design while experimenting with TailwindCSS!

      I hope to hear back from you guys soon as I'm super excited about being able to continue my goal in software, to help create real products to better others!
